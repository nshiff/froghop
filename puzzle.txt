I see so many great solutions to the problem at the end of the video. Thank you all! Here is another tough problem that I don't know the answer to...

For any initial string of waterlogged (X) and normal lily pads (_), can you always add a finite number of normal lily pads to the end so that it is solvable?

Example... the string _ X X X can be solved by adding four normal lily pads to the end:
_ X X X _ _ _ _.

Example... the string _ X _ X _ _ _ X X can be solved by adding six normal lily pads to the end:
_ X _ X _ _ _ X X _ _ _ _ _ _.

We can record our results using binary. Normal lily pads are 1 and waterlogged lily pads are 0. So the first example is a binary string 1000 with the answer 10001111. Do all binary strings have answers? If not - what is the lowest binary string that results in a failure?ï»¿
